# Projects

Below are some of my personal projects.

## Pudding

Pudding is a project that enables you to run various machine learning algorithms on Nvidia's GPU. It's written in CUDA and C/C++. I also provide a python binding for it so one can use it more easily. For more details, please refer the [project page](https://duconnor.github.io/Pudding/).
